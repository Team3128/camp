Dear --Name--,

Thank you so much for helping us over the summer with our Robotics Summer Camp at Canyon Crest Academy. The work that you did really helped to encourage younger students to pursue technology and engineering as they moved forward in their school career. I, along with the rest of our robotics team and the Canyon Crest Foundation, would like to extend our thanks and gratitude for your time. 

I hope that you will come join us again next year as continue to our efforts to reach out to younger students and allow them to explore the awesome opportunities offered in the realm of science, engineering and technology.

Thanks!
