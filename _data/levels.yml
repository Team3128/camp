    Campers learn the fundamentals of physics and basic engineering principles through building simple machines with VEX
    IQ robotics kits. Throughout the week, we'll work our way up to building a robot that can be controlled with a joystick!

    This summer, we have an awesome camp for our elementary students! Get started by building simple machines that come
    together to create an awesome robot that you can control through a joystick.
    <br><br>
    All week, campers will be engaged in learning about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics using VEX IQ
    robot kits. During the week, we will build simple machines powered by motors. Then, students will bring those separate
    parts together to create a bigger robot that they can control via a joystick. We’ll be building different robots on
    different days, so come and join us!

    Whether your student has never built a robot before or has some experience, this is the place for them! We’ll show them
    basic mechanical design and programming using versatile yet easy-to-learn software and robotics kits. Using VEX IQ robotics
    sets, campers design, build, and program robots to complete complex challenges.

    This summer, we’re proud to offer a week of fun where campers can come and build awesome robots, run around, and have fun.
    All week we’ll be using VEX IQ robot sets to build robots that complete complex challenges that teach campers mechanical
    and programming skills, while getting them excited about engineering and technology.
    <br><br>
    Not only will we get students going on build robots, they’ll also get to compete against each other by trying to score the
    most points in our end of the week competition. And every step of the way we’ll have counselors and staff alongside them to
    make sure they get the guidance they need to reach their goal.

    Our upper camp is aimed at students who want to start working in larger groups to create
    more complex and incredibly powerful robots. While still accessible for beginners, we use more advanced VEX Robotics robot sets that
    enable campers to go beyond and build awesome robots.
