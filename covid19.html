        <hr>
        <h2>We recognize that the recent spread of the novel coronavirus has raised many concerns over the past couple of weeks and has led to many closures nationwide. At this point in time, we have decided that Summer Camp will remain open. However, as this is a developing situation, this decision could be rescinded in the future depending on what transpires leading up to Camp. As always, the safety and health of our campers and counselors is our top priority. For any inquiries that you might have, please do not hesitate to contact at us at <a href="mailto:camp@team3128.org">camp@team3128.org</a>.

                    <h2>Cancellations</h2>
                   Please be aware that due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19, camp may have to be canceled partially or completely with less than 24 hours notice to parents. 
If camp is cancelled due to COVID-19 more than two weeks prior to the start date, all parents will receive a complete refund. If camp is cancelled within two weeks go the start date, There will be a small service fee in order to make up for lost expenses (for example, food purchases in preparation for camp). 
The fee will be in proportion to how much money is spent on pre-camp purchases. This amount is typically small, so parents will receive a fee that shall not exceed $20.
