                    <h2>Cancellations</h2>
                    Due to the current COVID-19 situation, unfortunately Robotics Camp for the 2020 Summer is fully canceled. If you have previously
                    registered for the camp, you should have received an email regarding this update. We are currently figuring out how refunding 
                    is going to work. We thank you for your patience as we plan the appropriate next steps. More updates coming soon.
                    
                    <!--
                        Please be aware that due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19, camp may have to be canceled partially or completely with less than 24 hours notice to parents. 
                    If camp is cancelled due to COVID-19 more than two weeks prior to the start date, all parents will receive a complete refund. If camp is cancelled within two weeks go the start date, There will be a small service fee in order to make up for lost expenses (for example, food purchases in preparation for camp). 
                    The fee will be in proportion to how much money is spent on pre-camp purchases. This amount is typically small, so parents will receive a fee that shall not exceed $20.
