Looking for a fun way to spend the summer? Join us for 5 weeks of robotics! We
build robots, play games, eat food, and just have an awesome time. Join the rest
of our staff and help us get students interested in designing, programming, and
testing robots, all while enjoying the comrade of a week long camp. Weâ€™ll even
provide food for the entire week.

Below are our paid and volunteer opportunities. Please read the individual
descriptions and contact us at camp@team3128.org. Please include a resume
and references.
