#### What is Aftercare?

Our camp offers extended care for students that need to get picked up later. Usually our camps
end at 3p with pickup lasting until 3:30p. For campers that need to stay later, we offer additional
care for a fee.

#### When is pickup time?

Campers in the Aftercare program need to get picked up at 5pm.

#### What will campers do during this time?

Campers will hang out with our staff and play either indoor or outdoor games, watch movies, or
even take a tour of our robotics workshop.

#### How much does it cost?

A week of Aftercare costs $100. This can be written as a check to Canyon Crest Academy
Foundation, and either mailed or dropped off on the first day of camp. See our
[registration policies](/camp/about/registration) for more information on payment.

#### How do I sign up?

In order to sign up, please bring the payment (above) to your first day of robotics camp. You'll
be able to sign up during the initial check in.

#### What if my child is not signed up for Aftercare but remains at camp past 3:30p?

A charge of $15 per every 15 minutes will be applied to campers who stay past the pickup time without having registered for Aftercare. Late pickup fees can be written as a check to the Canyon Crest Academy Foundation, and can either be mailed or dropped off before the week ends. See our [registration policies](/camp/about/registration) for more information on payment.
