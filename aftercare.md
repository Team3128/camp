### What is Aftercare?

Our camp offers extended care for students that need to get picked up later. Usually our camps 
end at 3p with pickup lasting until 3:30p. For campers that need to stay later, we offer additional
care for a fee. 

### When is pickup time?

Campers in the Aftercare program need to get picked up at 5pm. 

### What will campers do during this time?

Campers will hang out with our staff and play either indoor or outdoor games, watch movies, or
even take a tour of our robotics workshop. 

### How much does it cost?

A week of Aftercare costs $100. This can be written as a check to Canyon Crest Academy 
Foundation, and either mailed or dropped off on the first day of camp. See our 
[registration policies](/camp/about/registration) for more information on payment.
