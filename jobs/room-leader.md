#### Work Life
A typical day for a Room Leader starts at 7:00am with a staff meeting with the Camp Director to overview the day and any special tasks that need to be carried out. Afterwards Room Leaders will lead individual room Counselor Meetings to communicate to the Volunteer Counselors the activities happening during the day and any special information they need.

When campers arrive at 8:30a, Room Leaders will sign in kids and direct Volunteer Counselors in leading pre-camp games. During the camp day, Room Leaders will interact with campers and other staff to engage campers in activities and answer questions about the robotics kits and challenges. Room Leaders will be responsible for directing their room towards the different activities and meal times on time, and handling conflicts and minor  accidents.

At the end of the day, Room Leaders will sign out kids. After all campers have left, Room Leaders will hold Counselor Meetings to review the day, note camper’s progress with the days activities, and get feedback for future weeks. Room Leaders will usually leave around 4:00pm.
