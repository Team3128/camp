This summer, we’re proud to partner with e2 Young Engineers to provide
engineering camps for our 1st – 4th graders. Campers can come and learn topics
in Physics and basic engineering principles and use motorized Lego®  models to
reinforce STEM-related topics.

All week, campers will be engaged in learning about science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics using  their own LEGO® kits. In between the
learnings, we will also head outside for some awesome games and fun.
