This summer, we have an awesome new camp for our elementary students! Get started by building simple machines that come together to create an awesome robot that you can control through a joystick.   

All week, campers will be engaged in learning about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics using VEX IQ robot kits. During the week, we will build simple machines powered by motors. Then, students will bring those separate parts together to create a bigger robot that they can control via a joystick. We'll be building different robots on different days, so come and join us!
