# Camp Marketing Overview
The following is an overview of all of the planning elements that go into marketing the Robotics Summer Camp. Each year, administrative staff should look at these elements and make sure they are completed.

This list is ordered logically, as many of the later items rely on information from the former items.

## Basic Logistics

### Dates, Locations, & Pricing
These are the building blocks for your camp. When any parents asks about camp, the first things they'll want to know are:

- **Dates**: What weeks will the camp fall on? How long will each camp session last (days and hours)? What time is drop-off? What time is pick-up? Is there extended care after the pick-up time? 
- **Locations**: Where will the camp be located? Knowing both the general location (Canyon Crest Academy) and the more specific location (room numbers) will help to answer questions like: "How do I get to drop off?".
- **Pricing**: How much will the camp cost? Are there discounts available? Are there scholarships available? When does registration open? When is payment due? Are there any extra packages available? What itemized things does my registration fee get me? How many slots are available per camp session?

All of these items need to be declared, and ran by the organization that you're running camp through to make sure they are in line with rules & regulations. 

### Volunteers
Once you know when and where the camp is going to be, and approximately how many campers you are going to be accepting, you can start asking for volunteers to sign up. Other things to consider for volunteers:

- **Age/Grade/Gender/Expertise**: Depending upon what is happening each week and in each camp program, the requirements you have for your different volunteers might change. Advertising an all-girls week might require that you solicit specifically female volunteers to help with your program for that week. You might want to set a grade, age, or past experience requirements to help you get the right volunteers.
- **Slot Requirements**: You know how many campers you'll have slots for each week, you also need to know how many volunteer slots you'll have each week. Setting a ratio of volunteers to campers helps you keep the big picture in mind. This also helps budgeting later on.
- **Other Restrictions**: We've found it helpful to put limits on the number of times volunteers can participate each summer. Volunteers can get bored after several repetitious weeks, and create problems.

### Staffing
Finally, you need to figure out who is going to manage all of the people set up above. At the top level, your staff are your rocks that will be there for each week of camp, and will help you bring consistent quality despite the ever changing volunteers and campers.

- **Define Responsibilities**: Before deciding on staffing, you'll need to look at all the different things that need to get done during the camp week. This might be everything from registration/check-in to accounting, photography, meal preparation, or more. All of these responsibilities need to be listed so you can figure out who will take care of them,
- **Define Roles**: Responsibilities need to be grouped and divided into roles. These different roles might be positions like: Camp Director, Room Leader, Support Staff, Administrative Assistant, Recreation Director, etc. You should aim to limit the number of roles in your camp to what logically makes sense. 
- **Set Up Positions**: Now you have several different roles, its time to define particular positions. This involves taking a role, and pairing it with a context. For instance, the role of Room Leader in the context of the 7th & 8th grade room would give us the 7th & 8th Grade Room Leader. You might need to define ratios, such as one room leader per physical room (or per 16 campers). You might need to hire several people to fill a position (2-3 Support Staff). 


### Bringing it all together
Once you've defined all of the above logistical information, you have enough information to move forward and starting strategizing about how each week of camp will execute, as well as getting together marketing materials for all of the third parties you'll need to communicate to about camp.

## Marketing
A lot of people are necessary to make camp happen over a summer. Staff, volunteers, and campers are all vital parts of making camp a reality. In order to reach each group, you'll need to create a Marketing Strategy.

### Discounts & Scholarships
Before you start advertising, look at some promotions you might run. Offering discounts helps parents feel like they're getting a deal, while scholarships allow you to bring in students that might otherwise not get a chance to go.

In the past, we've done:

- **Returning Camper Discount.** We offer all returning campers $50 off the registration fee for the camp. This gives past customers a reason to come back, and new customers a reason to put a reminder in their calendar for next year. We allow family members of the returning campers to use the discount as well.
- **Priority Registration.** We also allow all returning campers to sign up earlier than the general population. This increases the slots filled earlier in the year, creating more momentum and easier planning.
- **Scholarship Fund.** We offer most students a $100 scholarship for any sort of financial need. Higher amounts of funding are available after a sort survey that helps us determine the nature of the situation.

When making a discount or scholarship strategy, use a couple of guidelines:

- **Define the offer.** What's the discount/scholarship amount? What are the requirements to geting it? Is there a time limit? Is there a limit per customer? Does it only apply to certain weeks?
- **Calculate the impact.** How many campers might be impacted by this offer? What is the maximum loss in revenue it can generate? What is the expected loss in revenue? Will the increased number of campers offset this loss? 10 campers @ 450 = $4,500, but 12 campers @ 400 = $4,800. In this case, as long as you add two additional campers to sales, you've came out ahead. If you don't, you've lost revenue.
- **Adjust as necessary.** If the offer you're planning on making available creates too big of a loss, you should tweak the offer to limit the impact. Creating general rules for the maximum amount of revenue you're willing to loose to promotions is a great idea.


###Email
One of the quickest and cheapest ways to reach out to parents or students is email. 

- Create a general information email with a couple of quick lines about what's happening at camp, what the dates are, and where they can find more information. This is your default email when parents contact you looking for details. 
- Write an email to past campers about the new opportunity this summer. You might need to write several aimed at different groups including returning campers for each camp, campers ready to graduate to the next program, campers that might become volunteers, etc. 


###Flyers
Flyers going home with students at schools is a great way to reach parents. Reaching out to schools and delivering printed flyers to them makes it fairly easy to advertise your camp with very little cost.

To use flyers effectively:

- Create a single flyer that will go out to as many people as possible. Simple and direct is best. We don't usually include ages or costs on ours, which directs as many people towards are site as possible and gives us a lot of flexibility.
- Have the flyer approved by your organization. 
- If you are running under a Non-Profit Organization, get a copy of their Letter of Status. This will help you pass out flyers in schools and other areas that commercial companies are not able to as easily.
- Contact schools and other places you'd like to distribute your flyer to. Record counts of flyers and any special instructions (5 stacks of 35, for instance)
- Some schools will require you to contact their district/other governing body before allowing you to distribute flyers. Make sure you get a letter stating your clearance to distribute flyers and give a copy of that letter to every school you send flyers to.
- Deliver the flyers and copies of clearance letters to each school.

### Other Mediums of Promotion

- **Newspapers/Magazines**: Look at nearby newspapers and magazines that parents might read and insert advertisements or articles into the paper. Each year, we conduct a marketing survey right after registration that helps us identify potential publishing partnerships.
- **Social Media**: We use social media as a outlet for highlights during the weeks of camp. By releasing pictures of campers having fun and awesome events, it both allows parents to see what is going on, as well as builds a reputation of excitement around the camp.

### Campers
The most obvious group that needs to be found is campers. They are paying customers who allow the camp to function, be fun, and create a profit. Remember that, while it is very important to make sure campers and interested and engaged, your leading customer is the parent. 



Strategies that we employ to reach campers include:

- **Email past campers with information about upcoming opportunities.** Each year we take our past list of campers and give them an invitation code that both grants them a discount to the following year's camp sessions, and allows them to register early. This let's us get repeat customers with a lower learning curve.
- **Distribute flyers to local schools.** We partner with elementary and middle schools to pass out flyers to students. Most schools will put these flyers right in folders that go home to parents, which means that it is easy to spread the word.
- **Present at local schools.** We bring our FRC team's robots to local schools during a lunch or other break to show off to students. They might get to drive the robot, and at the same time we can get them excited about going to camp and playing with robots during the summer.
- **Present on local media.** Similiar to presenting at schools, we partner with local media to present either on air, or be featured in an article. Usually the article focuses on our successes as a robotics team, and then talks about our camp offering near the end.
