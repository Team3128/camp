Announce early! Many camps are already signing up by early March or April as parents must plan their summer vacations and camp time!
Can't provide suggestions on how to make the camp better until my child has had a chance to take it.
Challenge the boys to utilize their creativity and help them be successful. They enjoy working with friends too.
Have a lot of hands on experience and each student should work on their ideas and own robot to get the most out of the learning experience. Also provide examples of completed projects to get their ideas going
Have not heard any follow up after registration.
Having them work in teams is great and having them explain their creations to their class really helps their public speaking skills and confidence. Justin is looking forward to your camp.
Just hoping you will inspire Alfie to think creatively within the science disciplines. Want him to have fun and enjoy being part of a team.
"Like being able to customize and not have everyone making identical projects; like being able to ""freestyle"" (no instructions), but having an experienced counselor oversee"
Looking forward to the camp. We have recommended it to 2 other boys.
Looking forward to the first time experience this summer.
Lots of hand on time but with close supervision in case the kids need help
"more kids will join the camp if you can extend the camp time period, such as from 8:30am to 4:30pm"
"My child hasn't attended yet, so we're not sure. :-) I hope he has a positive, hands on experience while learning about robotics, including building and programming. He will be attending CCA and may consider joining the robotics club if this is a positive experience."
"Parents like to be prepared so a ""what to expect"" e-mail with 1st day prep etc. is always nice. Don;t underestimate how smart the kids are their ready for a challenge and some fun!"
"Since the is the first year we are attending, we are really looking forward to it!"
Some basic instruction guidance to help the students work as teams and truly collaborate. Observing the last day there was often not a common understanding/game plan for students on the same team.
The campers can self-guided and worked at their own pace and at different levels.
"They participated in LEGO Engineering when offered at Holmes Elementary school. We talked to robotics team members at the state competition and they were so encouraging, informative and friendly, the boys wanted to sign up for camp right away!"
"This is my son's first robotics camp, so I have no comments at this time. Perhaps I will after the camp week."
We did one robotics camp before (he was probably too young) but the teacher did almost ALL of the programming and he was bummed.
We read the 92129 Magazine.
Will be able to fill out this portion during or near the end of camp session.
"Would like my son to learn and get hands on experience in all aspects of robotics to include design, programming, operating the robots. I looking for my son to see the creative side of technology and hopefully develop new interests"
