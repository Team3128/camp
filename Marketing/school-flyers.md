# Distributing School Flyers

Making flyers for camp available in schools is an incredibly simple way of advertising your camp to parents. 
There are just a couple steps to making this happen:

- [ ] Create and approve flyer.
- [ ] Identify schools/grades to be advertised to.
- [ ] Obtain Letter of 501(c)3 status for non-profit organizations.
- [ ] Contact school districts to approve flyer.
- [ ] Contact schools to get desired dropoff quantity and location.
- [ ] Print and sort flyers.
- [ ] Deliver flyers.

#### Create and approve flyer.
Design a flyer for the camp that clearly lists the dates, times, location, and other relevant information about the camp.

If you are with a non-profit organization (like Canyon Crest Academy Foundation), make sure to add language on the 
flyer that recognizes the organization. This will be helpful when getting your flyer approved both by the organization
as well as by the school districts.

#### Identify schools/grades to be advertised to.

#### Obtain Letter of 501(c)3 status for non-profit organizations
In order to prove your 501(c)3 status to school districts, you'll need to have your organization give you the letter of
status that proves they are a 501(c)3 organization. Each organization should have this, and it doesn't change so you
can keep this letter for future years.

#### Contact school districts to approve flyer.
Most school districts required that they approve the flyer being distributed to their schools. You'll want to connect with
someone in the school district and ask them to point you to the person that approves flyers for distribution to schools.

After you've found that person, send them your flyer in a request for approval. If you're a non-profit organization, 
make sure to also include your Letter of Status. They should respond to you within 48 hours with an approval letter. If not,
you should follow up with them on the status of your approval.

#### Contact schools to get desired dropoff quantity and location.
Once you have district approval, you need to contact each school you will be giving flyers to and inquire to how many flyers
it makes sense to give them. Some schools will be able to distribute the flyers directly to classes, while others will
only display them in the front office.

Calling for a secretary of each school and asking how many they would like is the easiest way to do this. Explain who you are
and that you've been approved by the school district. Each secretary will know how their school distributes flyers and will 
either know the number needed, or direct you to someone to answer your question.

#### Print and sort flyers.
Once you have all the desired counts, the next step is to print and sort flyers. Some schools will be asking for multiple
stacks of a quantity (7 stacks of 35) to make it easy for class distribution. Some schools will ask for a single lump sum
that will later be sorted and distributed. In either case, make sure stacks are separated and grouped by school. Make sure
that each stack has a letter of approval from the district.

#### Deliver flyers.
Divide and conquor. Deliver all flyers to their intended schools. Make sure to check on their office hours as you do not
want to start too late in the day and find that they are not open. Go to the front office, explain who you are, and show 
them your district letter of approval. Make sure all the stacks intended for each school are delivered.
