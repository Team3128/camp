Hello Parents,

As camp draws closer, this is a notification that we currently have you marked as having a balance due for your camper’s registration, and this balance must be paid by --Payment Due Date-- to secure your slot at camp. 

To make a payment, please write a check payable to ‘Canyon Crest Academy Foundation’ and either drop-off or mail it to:

Canyon Crest Academy Foundation
5951 E Village Center Loop Rd. 
San Diego, CA 92130

Campers with balance's due after --Payment Due Date-- are in jeopardy of loosing their slot.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
