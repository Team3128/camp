Hello!

I’m --Insert Camp Director-- from Robotics Summer Camps at Canyon Crest Academy, and let me be the first to welcome you to Summer Camp --Camp Year--! All of our staff and counselors are so excited to meet your campers and spend an awesome week with them building robots!

Here’s some important information to know before you come:

**Payment** is required at the door on Monday, if we haven’t received them in the office by --Payment Due Date--. Please make sure all checks are payable to 'Canyon Crest Academy Foundation'. 

Every day, **camper drop off** starts at 8:30 am outside the Canyon Crest Academy Administration building. To find us, just enter through the main gate and turn left. You’ll sign in with your room leader right at the front. Pick up is at the same place starting at 3:00 pm.

**Camper Shirts** will be distributed at the end of Monday. We encourage campers to wear their shirts throughout the week to help us identify our campers. 

Our **Parent Hour** is each Friday at 2:00 pm. We invite Parents to join us to see what their campers have been up to all week. Just meet us at the Administration Building.

**Game and Kit** Information has been added to [our website](http://team3128.org/camp/) with kit and competition game information. Check it out to find out the gear and game your camper will be using. Purchasing information is also available.

Once again, we are very excited for camp this year. Please let me know if you have any questions.
