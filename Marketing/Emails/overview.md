# Email Overview
As a very important form of communication, email is essential to the 
camp experience. Because parents are only at camp for a limited time,
email is the best way to give them information.

Camp emails are broken into three time periods:

- Pre-Registration: Marketing emails -- These are emails that you can
send to people interested in camp in order to remind them to sign up.
- Post-Registration: Informational emails -- These are emails that 
inform parents about deadlines and other important details regarding
their upcoming camp session.
- Camp Week: Informational emails -- These are emails that update 
parents on what is happening at camp during the week.
