Hello Parents!

Its Thursday! And we’ve been having an awesome week. I wanted to give you another quick update on what is going on.

Over the past couple days, campers have been working to build robots to compete against other teams in competition. Along with the guidance of our mentors, they brainstormed, designed, built, and have been testing their creations and matches will be starting soon.

Not only that, we’ve also taken some time out to do some super cool things like play around with the large high school FRC robot, and figure out who the true champions of dodgeball really are.

A quick reminder: our **Parent Hour** starts at 2:00pm on Friday. You can come by and check out what your camper has been doing all week; it will be an awesome time.

Can’t wait to see you guys!
