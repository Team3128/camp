Hello!

I’m Tyler Carter from Robotics Summer Camps at Canyon Crest Academy, and let me be the first 
to welcome you to Summer Camp 2016! All of our staff and counselors are so excited to meet your 
campers and spend an awesome week with them building robots!

Here’s some important information to know before you come:

Our **Monday Check-In** will happen at 8:30a. Here we will make sure your payment, waivers, and 
everything else is ready to go.

Every day, **Camper Drop Off** starts at 8:30 am outside the Canyon Crest Academy Administration building. 
To find us, just enter through the main gate and turn left. You’ll sign in with your room leader right 
at the front. **Pick up** is at the same place starting at 3:00 pm. 

You can sign up for our
[Aftercare](http://team3128.org/camp/aftercare) program for extended care after camp. Campers that have not been picked up by
3:30p will be charged for Aftercare for that day.

**Camper Shirts** will be distributed at the end of Monday. We encourage campers to wear their shirts 
throughout the week to help us identify our campers. We also encourage students to bring reusable 
water bottles to help them stay hydrated during the week.

Our **Parent Hour** is each Friday at 2:00 pm. We invite Parents to join us to see what their campers 
have been up to all week. Just meet us at the Administration Building.

If during the week you need to contact us, please either send us an email at camp@team3128.org, 
or you can call us on-site at 858-350-0253 x4173. 

Once again, we are very excited for camp this year. Please let me know if you have any questions.
