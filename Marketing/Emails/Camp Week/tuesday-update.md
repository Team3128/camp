Hello Parents!

It is so exciting to be able to give you an update on what your campers have been doing during this last two weeks of camp.

Yesterday, we got to meet campers for the first time and introduce them to our VEX IQ and VEX EDR robotics kits. By lunch, we already had robots zooming across the fields - it was awesome!

Since then, we’ve learned a ton about programming robots and using sensors. At lunch, the upper and lower camp faced off in an intense battle of dodgeball! And our 7th & 8th graders got introduced to their competition: VEX Skyrise.

We can’t wait to see your campers tomorrow. 5th & 6th Grade will be starting their competition game: VEX Highrise. It is going to be awesome!
