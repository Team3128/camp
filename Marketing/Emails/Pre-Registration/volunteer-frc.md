Hey guys!

This summer we have another exciting opportunity to engage younger students in the awesome world of robotics. 
For the third year, we'll be running our Robotics Summer Camp at Canyon Crest Academy. Each week, we'll bring 
in 50 campers to learn how to build robots using simple robotics kits similar to LEGOs. 

But, we need to get the kids first! Here's how you can help:  
  
Talk to people you know that have kids between the ages of 10 - 14. Send them to http://team3128.org/camp/ for 
more information on camp. Tell them it is amazing. Tell them it helps support your school/robotics team. Tell 
them how it can get their kid hooked on science and technology. Tell them to email me or Tyler if they have 
any questions.  
  
Volunteer at camp! We need as many as 60 volunteers during the 5 weeks. If you have a couple weeks available, 
either head to our website to find out more, or just fill out the form.  
  
Help us advertise! You can talk to me or Tyler to find out how you can help us out reaching people to fill all 240 
slots during the summer.  
  
Please feel free to forward this to any of your friends, family, or teachers that would like to help out. We 
have a very ambitious goal of reaching 240 campers this summer, which means we need 60 volunteers to help us 
out! That's 300 people getting super excited for robotics!

Please let me know if you have any questions.
