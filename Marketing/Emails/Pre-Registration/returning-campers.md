Hello Robotics Campers & Parents!

This summer, weâ€™re so excited to welcome you back to Robotics Summer Camps @ Canyon Crest Academy for an engaging summer of building robots with students. And we want to make sure you get in first!

This year, we're opening registration early to returning campers from now until March 20th. Simply go to our [5th & 6th](https://fs30.formsite.com/ccaf/RoboticsSummerCamp56/index.html) or [7th & 8th](https://fs30.formsite.com/ccaf/RoboticsSummerCamp78/index.html) grade registration form and use the invitation code **{invitation_code_here}** to register.

Like last year, campers will work with high school students to learn about engineering and problem solving by attacking complex challenges and competing against each other in a three-day competition. This year we're kicking it up a notch with all new robot challenges, robotics demonstrations from local companies, and lots of new ways to have fun.

Camp dates run from July 5th to August 5th with drop-off starting at 8:30am and pick up ending at 3:30pm. Lunch and snack included. To find out more, check out our [website](http://team3128.org/camp/). Each week has limited availability, so sign up soon!

Hope to hear from you soon!
