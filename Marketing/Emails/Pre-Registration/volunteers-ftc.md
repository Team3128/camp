Hey everyone,

I'm --Insert Name/Description--. As some of you may know, we host a robotics summer camp here on campus every year and yet again, we're reaching out to you guys for your help! We need 60 volunteers to educate 1st through 8th graders in robotics using VEX kits and software similar to LEGOs. Here are the details:

You'll be assigned to up to 2 weeks out of 5 to help teach groups of 3-4 students for 5 days a week, 8 hours each day. Food will be provided and you'll also get to have fun playing dodgeball, frisbee, and other games with kids! If you're interested, please visit our [volunteer page](http://team3128.org/camp/jobs/volunteer) for more information or just fill out the volunteer form!

Please feel free to forward this to any of your friends, family, or teachers that would like to help out. We have a very ambitious goal of 240 campers this summer which means we need at least 60 volunteers to help! That's a total of 300 people getting super excited for robotics!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
