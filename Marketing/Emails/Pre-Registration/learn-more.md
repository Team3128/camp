Hello!

You’re receiving this email because recently, you asked to be sent more information about our Robotics Summer Camps at Canyon Crest Academy. 

This summer, we’re very excited to engage campers in 5th/6th and 7th/8th grade by spending a week building robots with students. Campers will work with high school students to learn about engineering and problem solving by attacking complex challenges and competing against each other in a three-day competition.

During the camp we’ll also do awesome things like control large 120-pound robots, play games like capture the flag, eternal dodgeball, and don’t forget our annual Campers vs. Counselor Ultimate Frisbee game!

Camp dates run from --Camp Start Date-- to --Camp End Date-- with drop-off starting at 8:30am and pick up ending at 3:30pm. Lunch and snack included. To find out more, check out our [website](http://team3128.org/camp/). Each week has limited availability, so sign up soon!

Hope to hear from you soon!
