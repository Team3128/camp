Hello!

You’re receiving this email because recently you asked to be sent more information about the Aluminum Narwhals' Robotics Summer Camps at Canyon Crest Academy.

This summer, we’re very excited to engage campers in 5th/6th and 7th/8th grade by spending a week building robots with them. Campers will work with high school students to learn about engineering and problem solving by attacking complex challenges and competing against each other in a competition at the end of the week.

During the camp we’ll also do awesome things like control large 120-pound robots, play games like capture the flag, eternal dodgeball, and don’t forget our annual Campers vs. Counselor Ultimate Frisbee game!

Camp dates run from the week of July 5th to August 5th with drop-off starting at 8:30am and pick up ending at 3:30pm. Lunch and snack included. To find out more, check out our website. Registration opens March 21st; we'll send you an email then to remind you.

Thanks for your interest!
