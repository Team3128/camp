# Robotics Summer Camp
In 2014, FRC Team 3128 started a summer camp aimed at engaging and educating 
students about robotics in an exciting and fun environment.

This set of documents aims to provide documentation on how our camp runs. 
Many of the documents here are specific to our school and situation, but by 
using it as a guide it is our hope that you can take our idea and be able to
start your own camp.
