**Competition Kickoff Brainstorm:** On Wednesday, we'll kick off our three-day tournament with a strategy session that will help campers figure out how to attack this year's competition game. Counselors and campers will collaborate in groups to figure out how to go about building their robot and playing the game over the next three days.
